# 🌀 Customer Churn Prediction Model  
*👩‍💻 Built with 💙 during IBM ICE Day 2024 Solvathon!*  

## 📖 Overview  
In this project, our team developed a machine learning model to predict **customer churn** within a business context. Churn prediction helps organizations proactively identify customers at risk of leaving and implement retention strategies. This model was built during the **3-hour Solvathon** at IBM ICE Day 2024. 🚀  

## 🏆 Highlights  
- ⏱️ **3-hour Hackathon:** A challenging yet exciting experience!
- 💡 **Business Impact:** Tackling customer retention with actionable insights.  
- 🤖 **Machine Learning:** Leveraging predictive modeling techniques.  
- 🎯 **Goal:** Help businesses improve retention rates and optimize customer engagement.
